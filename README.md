##What Is It?
Project Cube is a Minecraft-like game made with HTML, CSS, and JS.

##Design
Project Cube is designed to look like Minecraft, but without the copyright infringements. Both have their ups and downs, so it just depends on what you want most.

##Gameplay
Project Cube is an open-world game with no way to have your creation obliterated, plenty of blocks, and no rules. All you have to do is start building!

##System Requirements
CPU: Intel Atom E640 (or better)<br>
GPU: EVGA GeForce 8400 GS (or better)<br>
RAM: 2GB DDR2 (or better)<br>

##What's the Difference?
Minecraft and Project Cube are very different, but build around the same idea.
